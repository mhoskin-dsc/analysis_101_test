The <a href=\"https://best-practice-and-impact.github.io/qa-of-code-guidance/principles.html\">Principles page</a> contains a useful overview for anyone involved in the running of an analytical project and talks through the three founding principles of good analysis:</p><ul><li><strong>Reproducible</strong> - Other analysts should be able to replicate the work performed; if they run the same analysis, on the same data, they should obtain the same results. Transparency here underpins the above two principles, and supports the requirements of the <a href=\"https://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/code-of-practice/\">Code of Practice for Statistics</a>.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Auditable</strong> - The reasons behind the analysis should be known, any decisions made should be based on evidence and recorded to safeguard during future scrutiny.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Assured</strong> - Often through peer review, the analytical choices made should be understood and reasonable. Quality Assurance should be proportional - analysts shouldn't be overburdened with procedure when unnecessary - and guidance on this is often taken from the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-aqua-book-guidance-on-producing-quality-analysis-for-government\">Aqua Book</a>.</li></ul>",
